# Yeetpiler

This project was inspired by the post https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/bgdxwn/yeet/. 

This program will interpret C and C++ code, then write obfuscated code where all possible tokens are some variation of yeet. The code will still be run since all of the yeets will be defined in a single header file shared by all yeeted files.


## Running the yeetpiler

    python3 [-r][-i input_path][-o output_path]
